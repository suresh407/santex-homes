        <h3>The SanTex pledge</h3>
        <p>The drive and desire to not just sell a product but to sell the best product in the industry along with giving our customers the best service before and after the sale</p>
        <h4>What makes SanTex homes different:</h4>
        <p>“We have building facilities that make the homes, we sell them, insure them, service them, but best of all, we offer the best financing for your home. We can do all this at the best price value to our customers. I feel that if a customer doesn’t buy from me, I have done them a huge disservice. I will do what it takes to earn a customer’s business.”</p>
        <p>SanTex homes supports Mission Malawi Africa and donates to feeding the hungry. SanTex Homes is also involved with the San Antonio Food Bank and supporting local food drives and volunteering to help the San Antonio and surrounding communities make a better tomorrow. </p>
